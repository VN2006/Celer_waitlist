🧬 Lovable Prompt — “Celer” Landing Page (Biologically Inspired Neural Motion)

Objective:
Create a cinematic, minimal landing page for Celer, the world’s first end-to-end multiomics copilot.
The site should combine the elegant simplicity of x.ai
 with an organic, biologically inspired neuron-firing animation that symbolizes connected intelligence and scientific precision.

Background Animation (React Three Fiber)

Use a 3D neuron-firing network as the background:

~80–100 nodes (spheres) connected by curved filaments (Bezier lines).

Each node emits a soft pulse of light that diffuses outward using a Gaussian bloom effect.

Firing sequence: slow, staggered activations (every 1–2 seconds), with slight randomness.

Occasional synchronized “bursts” across multiple nodes to simulate integration events.

Materials:

Nodes → MeshStandardMaterial (emissive purple #7C3AED)

Filaments → LineBasicMaterial (low opacity, glowing edges)

Lighting setup:

AmbientLight: low intensity (0.2)

PointLight: centered on camera, soft falloff

Bloom effect: strength 1.5, radius 0.4, threshold 0.2

Depth of Field: focus at network center

Camera Motion:

Use OrbitControls (autoRotate = true, speed = 0.3, dampingFactor = 0.1)

Subtle parallax tilt on mouse movement.

Performance:

Use useFrame to randomize node activations.

Suspend re-renders with r3f/drei's Instances for batching.

Fallback for prefers-reduced-motion: static SVG web with faint violet glow.

(The effect should feel like fluorescent neurons gently lighting up — realistic calcium imaging energy rather than sci-fi speed.)

🧬 About Celer – End-to-End Multiomics Platform

Celer is an AI-powered, agentic SaaS platform that radically simplifies multiomics data analysis.
It automatically fetches datasets from repositories like GEO, PRIDE, and Metabolomics Workbench, transforms them into clean, analysis-ready formats, runs standardized pipelines, and delivers interactive visualizations — enabling researchers to move from raw data to discovery in hours.

Subheadline:

The Jarvis for Biology.

⚙️ How It Works (Animated 3-Step Flow)

3 horizontally aligned cards with animated linking glow (Framer Motion):

Pull Data
 Auto-fetch omics datasets (GEO, PRIDE, or uploads).

Analyze Data
 Agentic AI runs explainable workflows — DGE, proteomics, meta-analysis.

Visualize Insights
 Generate interpretable plots, tables, and downloadable CSVs.

(Loop a soft violet pulse moving between cards 1→2→3.)

🎯 Mission & Vision

Mission:

“To accelerate biological discovery by removing friction from data transformation and empowering researchers with intelligent, interpretable, and customizable agentic workflows.”

Vision:

“To become the operating system for biological data — a voice-driven AI assistant in every lab enabling faster, better, and more accessible scientific breakthroughs.”

Fully responsive + accessible

Functional /api/waitlist POST

Lighting and bloom effects create a subtle “fluorescent microscope” feel

Deployable on Vercel (fast build, no heavy dependencies)

Now generate the complete codebase.
Make sure the hero’s React Three Fiber canvas uses:

<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 8], fov: 55 }} shadows>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.2} />
  <pointLight position={[0, 0, 4]} intensity={1.5} />
  <EffectComposer>
    <Bloom intensity={1.5} luminanceThreshold={0.2} luminanceSmoothing={0.3} />
    <DepthOfField focusDistance={0.01} focalLength={0.03} bokehScale={2} />
  </EffectComposer>
</Canvas>


Use Framer Motion for smooth content entry animations and OrbitControls for slow network drift.

The finished product should feel like an intelligent, living organism — quiet, analytical, and alive.
